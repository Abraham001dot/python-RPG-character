# RPG Character Generator (Python)

A simple Python program that creates a role-playing game (RPG) character with validated stats and a clean visual display.

## Features
- Validates character name (length, format, and type)
- Enforces stat rules and total point limits
- Displays character stats using a visual dot system
- Clean and modular function-based design
  
- What I Learned
	•	Input validation in Python
	•	Writing reusable functions
	•	Using lists and loops for structured data
	•	Formatting clean terminal output

  Future Improvements
  •	Add character classes (Mage, Warrior, Rogue)
	•	Save characters to a file
	•	Load saved characters
